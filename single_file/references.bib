  abstract  = "SUMMARY: MMseqs2 taxonomy is a new tool to assign taxonomic
               labels to metagenomic contigs. It extracts all possible protein
               fragments from each contig, quickly retains those that can
               contribute to taxonomic annotation, assigns them with robust
               labels and determines the contig's taxonomic identity by
               weighted voting. Its fragment extraction step is suitable for
               the analysis of all domains of life. MMseqs2 taxonomy is 2-18x
               faster than state-of-the-art tools and also contains new modules
               for creating and manipulating taxonomic reference databases as
               well as reporting and visualizing taxonomic assignments.
               AVAILABILITY: MMseqs2 taxonomy is part of the MMseqs2 free
               open-source software package available for Linux, macOS and
               Windows at https://mmseqs.com. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
               Supplementary data is available at Bioinformatics online.",
