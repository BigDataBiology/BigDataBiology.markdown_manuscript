The global microbiome is very important.
# Introduction

This is the introduction to the paper.

Keep in mind that you are introducing the paper, and **not** the field as a whole.
Chekhov's gun principle applies: if you mention something in the introduction, it should be relevant to the paper and used later.

# Discussion

Since the _Results_ were already in _Results & Discussion_ section, this should be short.
