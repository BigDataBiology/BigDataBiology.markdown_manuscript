# Figures

The figures themselves should be done with [inkscape](https://inkscape.org/).
They should be saved as SVG files (which are commited to the repository).
PDF/PNG versions can be done at the time of building the document using the `inkscape` command line tool.

**Figure 1. Figure title.** This is a figure caption. **(a)** First panel.

Avoid overly-neutral titles (e.g., _Analysis of the samples_) and, instead, make some scientific claim in the title (e.g., _AMPs are separated by habitat_).
The caption needs to describe all the panels unambiguously and clearly.
