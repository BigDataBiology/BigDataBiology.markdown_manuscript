# Introduction

This is the introduction to the paper.
You can use references [@coelhoBiogeographyProkaryoticGenes2022;@mirditaFastSensitive2021].

Keep in mind that you are introducing the paper, and **not** the field as a whole.
Chekhov's gun principle applies: if you mention something in the introduction, it should be relevant to the paper and used later.
